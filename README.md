# Ensemble Model for Pneumonia Detection
This project implements an ensemble model combining Random Forest and SVM to detect pneumonia using protein sequence data. 

## Features
- Feature extraction using discere method
- Model training for Random Forest and Support Vector Machine
- Ensemble method using weighted majority algorithm (WMA)
